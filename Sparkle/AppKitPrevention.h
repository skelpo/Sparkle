// #include (not #import) this header to prevent AppKit from being imported
// Note this should be your LAST #include in your implementation file

// If this error is triggered, you can have Xcode indicate to you which source file including this header caused the issue

// One may wonder for certain targets where AppKit is banned completely, why just not link AppKit instead.
// Well, Xcode has thing called auto-linking that I don't trust very much.
// Even after trying to disable the setting, I've had targets able to link to AppKit without AppKit being specified in the list of linked libraries.

// Note: The prevention error is explicitly disabled when XCTest has been imported because with the changes to work with Swift in the framework target, it is unavoidable that AppKit appears to be imported even when it hasn't been.
#if defined(_APPKITDEFINES_H) && !defined(XCT_EXPORT)
