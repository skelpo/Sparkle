/// The API in Sparkle for controlling the user interaction.
///
/// This protocol is used for implementing a user interface for the Sparkle updater. Sparkle's internal drivers tell
/// an object that implements this protocol what actions to take and show to the user.
///
/// Every method in this protocol is required (i.e, not optional) and has a void return type and can optionally take a single parameter block,
/// which waits for a response back from the user driver. Note that every parameter block, or reply,///must* be responded to eventually - that
/// is, none can be ignored. Furthermore, they can only be replied to///once* - a reply or completion block should be considered invalidated
/// after it's once used. The faster a reply can be made, the more Sparkle may be able to idle, and so the better. Lastly, every method in this
/// protocol can be called from any thread. Thus, an implementor may choose to always dispatch asynchronously to the main thread. However, an
/// implementor should also avoid unnecessary nested asynchronous dispatches.
///
/// An implementor of this protocol should act defensively. For example, it may be possible for an action that says to invalidate or dismiss
/// something to be called multiple times in succession, and the implementor may choose to ignore further requests.
///
/// - Note: Once upon a time, when first developing the user driver API, I had the user driver exist in a separate process from the rest of the
///   framework. If you're familiar with how the higher level XPC APIs work, this explains why some of the decisions above were made (reply block
///   executed on any thread, reply block replied only once, single reply block, void return types, idleness, no optional methods, ...) This is
///   somewhat of an artifact (maybe?) now, but I think most of these set of restrictions still enforces a well designed API.

    /// A state flag indicating whether it is currently possible for the user to initiate an update check.
    ///
    /// Normally, a user can always initiate an update check. There are several conditions under which this is not
    /// the case, however. For example:
    ///
    ///   - A user-initiated check is already in progress
    ///   - An automatic check is already in progress
    ///   - An update is already being downloaded or installed
    ///   - The Internet connection is known to be offline
    ///   - The application is in the process of terminating
    ///   - An application-modal alert is active
    ///
    /// This flag corresponds conceptually to the "enabled" state of the standard "Check for Updates..." menu item provided
    /// by many applications. An object conforming to `NSUserInterfaceValidations` could store this value in a property
    /// and return it from `validateUserInterfaceItem(_:)`, for example.
    ///
    /// - Note: At the time of this writing, the getter for this property will never be invoked by Sparkle; it is required by
    ///   the protocol only because it is not possible to define a "write-only" property in either Objective-C or Swift. It is
    ///   nonetheless recommended that implementations provide a thread-safe getter as well as a thread-safe in case it is called
    ///   by other code or Sparkle's implementation changes.

    /// show the user exactly what information (if any) is sent with such checks. The implementation must invoke
    /// the `reply` callback to signal the user's choice.
